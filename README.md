Udemy Project Description
At Udemy, I have been asked by My manager, Head of Curriculum at Udemy, to present the data on course revenue, and I have been provided with data on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses.
My manager has suggested encouraging Web Development courses to charge more because she believes that these are the most popular courses. She needs to send a report to the CEO in the next three weeks on how they will increase their next quarterly earnings.
I have consolidated the data. I used data on prices of courses, number of reviews, number of lectures, content level, content duration, number of subscribers, rating, published timestamps, and subject.
Then cleaned the data and prepared it for Analysis using excel functions like IF-ELSE, VLOOKUP, etc. Then tried to understand the data by visualizing the data using pivot tables in Excel and Tableau. Tried to understand it, forming insights, and analyzed it.
I was trying to figure out what factors significantly influence the popularity of the courses? what courses are doing well, and what courses are not doing so well, also figuring out what can we do about that.
From my analysis, I concluded that we can increase the prices of the web development courses accordingly to take advantage of their popularity among subscribers/users. Business Finance courses need to improve their subscriber base by lowering prices a little while also improving the content of the courses making them more thorough. While the categories of courses that are not doing well should work on course content making them thorough and more comprehensive. 





The Problem
At Udemy. I have been asked by My manager, Head of Curriculum at Udemy, to present the data on course revenue, and I have been provided with data on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses.
My manager has suggested encouraging Web Development courses to charge more because she believes that these are the most popular courses. She needs to send a report to the CEO in the next three weeks on how they will increase their next quarterly earnings.
It took me three weeks in understanding and analyzing the data and reporting it properly. 
We needed the data involving various aspects of a MOOC which can be treated as the measure of its popularity, also those aspects which can be influencing the subscribility of the course. So I have consolidated the data that I used during my analysis, included data on prices of courses, number of reviews, number of lectures, content level, content duration, number of subscribers, rating, published timestamps, and subject. These data can be easily understood and presented through graphs and visualization.
To understand the problem, we need to find how can we measure the popularity of the course? After deciding on a good measure, we have to focus on the factors that can affect that? After finding some insights about the factors that are influencing the popularity, we need to figure out why and how those factors influence our data? Why are the courses which are doing well are doing well? Why the courses that are not doing well, are not doing well? What can we do about the problems with not-so-popular courses and how can we leverage the advantages we have on popular courses?









Design

The data that I consolidated was inconsistent. It contained duplicate records. There were few columns with lots of missing values. There were few empty rows as well. I removed duplicate and empty rows.
Used filer tool on excel to filer empty rows and duplicates tool to remove duplicate rows.

Tools used for analysis, visualization, and reporting:
Ms excel
I used google-spreadsheets for analyzing data as it is easy to use and a handy tool for data analysis.
Tableau
Tableau is one of the most popular visualization tools across the world because of its easy-to-use and handy interface to work on.
MS PowerPoint
I used MS PowerPoint for reporting because of its extensive features list which we can use to present reports. It is really easy to use.
Steps:
Read and worked on understanding the data.
Consolidate the relevant data.
Data cleaning
Removed duplicates
Removed blank cells
Removed/replaced inconsistent data
Used the VLOOKUP function to find and organize this information on a separate sheet.


Data visualization
Created the following Pivot Tables and Charts using excel and  tableau:
Total number of subscribers for each subject (Pie Chart)
The average number of subscribers for each subject (Bar Chart)
Average cost per subject at each level (Bar Chart)
Average content duration for each subject (Bar Chart)
Average rating per subject for each level (Column Chart)



















Findings

Finding 1:
Web Development courses are most popular among offered courses
While Musical Instruments courses are least popular among subscribers.






•


Finding 2:
Graphic Design Courses are also not doing pretty well.
Business Finance courses have relatively very low subscribers as compared to web development courses.












Finding 3:
In the case of Business Finance courses, they have a relatively very low subscriber base as compared to Web Dev Courses but have similar average prices to that of Web Development courses.











Finding 4:
The content of web dev courses is thorough while other courses are behind in that. This can be seen in the following charts which show the number of lectures per content and average content duration per category, respectively.
The average number of lectures a course per category.

Average content duration of a course per category.



Finding 5:
Website Development Courses subscribers are more proactive in reviewing content which can be seen in the chart showing the average number of reviews per category.









Analysis
 
Web Development courses are the most subscribed courses because:
As coding is computer-based learning and using the internet to learn these skills at just arm’s length. Along with this, online discussion forums and google play a huge part in making it more interactive learning.
One can get the best teachers to learn programming, right at home which is not an easy thing to get in remote areas of the world, we’re even having a proper school is a big deal.
Musical Instrument courses are least popular among masses because:
Students are not comfortable, learning to play musical instruments online.
Mentoring online is not a proper method to teach playing instruments. Students must not be able to learn properly online, they may need more in-person interaction with the mentors to properly learn to play instruments.
In the case of Business Finance courses, they have a relatively very low subscriber base as compared to Web Dev Courses but have similar average prices to that of Web Development courses. This may be hampering their potential to increase their subscriber base significantly.


One of the factors behind Web Development courses doing better than other categories- is the thorough content of web dev courses while other courses are behind in that. This can be seen in the following charts which show the number of lectures per content and average content duration per category, respectively.

The average number of lectures a course per category.

Average content duration of a course per category.


Web Development courses subscribers are proactive in using technology which is why these courses are doing well. This can be explained by the fact that they are more proactive in reviewing content which can be seen in the chart showing the average number of reviews per category.









Conclusions
In the case of Web Development courses, We can increase the prices of the courses accordingly to take advantage of their popularity among subscribers/users.
In the case of Business Finance courses, they can also improve their subscriber base by lowering prices a little while improving the content of the courses making them more thorough.
Category of courses that are not doing well, should work on course content making them thorough and more comprehensive.

The Problem
To understand the influence of the parent’s background, test preparation, etc. on students’ performance. I have consolidated the data. The data I used included data on Gender, Race, Ethnicity, Level of Education of the students’ parents, lunch facility given to students, student’s test preparation, maths scores, reading scores, and writing scores.
Then I cleaned the data and prepared it for analysis using excel functions like IF-ELSE, VLOOKUP, etc. Then, worked on understanding the data through visualization using pivot tables in Excel and Tableau. I worked on forming insights.
I was trying to figure out what factors significantly influence the students’ performance.
For my analysis, I concluded that females are doing better than males. Governments and institutions should keep running more and more encouraging policies for women. Special care should be given to children's nutrition. Every child’s nutrition should be a priority so that every child should get all the nutrients it needs through a nutritious diet. Upliftment of the backward races should be the top priority for the government and the institutions to encourage them towards learning. Parents should also educate themselves as it will significantly affect the performance of the child in a positive way. The extra focus should be given to kids to revise and review what they have been taught before.

Findings

Finding 1:
Female Students performed relatively better than Male Students.





•
Finding 2:
Students having standard lunch had performed relatively better than students with free/reduced-price lunch.










Finding 3:
Students from different Ethnicity  Groups performed differently.
Students from Group E performed better than students from other groups.
Students from Group A performed worse than students from other groups.
The Performance of the students in Group E was best, followed by Group D, C, B, and then A.



•
Finding 4:
The education Level of the parent plays a significant role in the  performance of the child as we can see in the graph on right.
As you can see in the graph, Kids of parents with a Master’s degree performed best among all, followed by parents with a bachelor's degree, parents with an associate's degree, etc.


•


Finding 5:
Students who completed their test preparation performed significantly better than the students who didn’t.



Analysis
 
Female students have performed well in the exams as schools and government have employed female-friendly policies, which aided significantly to their hard work.



Food and Nutrients play a significant part in the growth of the child, which also involves academic learning, and thus what a child eats also plays an important part in its learning, which can be seen in the lunch v/s average percentage chart.




As seen in the Race/Ethnicity v/s average percentage graph, the ethnicity child belonged to also has a significant influence on its performance, which may be due to various factors like economic conditions of the communities, social backwardness of the community, etc. 



As we can see in the parental education v/s average percentage graph, parental education plays a huge part in a child’s education. Being educated helps/support as well as influences a child’s learning.



The last graph i.e., Test Preparation v/s average percentage, shows that being prepared for tests significantly improved the performance of the student in the exams.




Conclusions
As with only a little upliftment, females are already doing well than males. Government and institutions should keep running more and more encouraging policies for women.
Special care should be given to the child’s nutrition. Every child’s nutrition should be a priority so that every child should get all the nutrients it needs through a nutritious diet.
Upliftment of the backward races should be the top priority for the government and the institutions to encourage them towards learning.
Parents should also educate themselves as it will significantly affect the performance of the child in a positive way.
The extra focus should be given to kids to revise and review what they have been taught before.
